    The place is Gotham City. The time, 1987 -- once removed.
  <section_mark>
    The city of Tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows, 
    dense, crowded, airless, a random tangle of steel and 
    concrete, self-generating, almost subterranean in its 
    aspect... as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and 
    kept on growing. A dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready 
    to burst.
